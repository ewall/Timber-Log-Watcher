Proposed refactoring of Timber Log Watcher:
	
	New feature: option of de-duplication for similar events
		supported by new event queue
	
	Two threads:
		
		1.) read from file using generator syntax, push findings to queue
			- how will this handle midnight reset and file-not-found?
			
		2.) process notifications popped from queue
			- implement options for showing chunk of recent logs (e.g. x-lines vs. to next space)
			- can add options for notification frequency
