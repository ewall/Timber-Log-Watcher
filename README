Description:
  Tails a log file and sends alert emails when the watched terms are seen.

Usage:
  Configure Timber.ini with the global options and words you want to watch for.

Requires:
  Python 2.5

Platforms:
  Should work on any platform with a Python interpretter.
  (My intention is to use it as a Windows service.)


Version History:
  1.0.2 = added "waitforfile" option and midnight reload
  1.0.1 = added reporting of the following lines from the log
  1.0.0 = simple working code

-----

Building on Windows:

  Requires Py2Exe (http://www.py2exe.org/); 7-zip (http://www.7-zip.org/) is optional.
  CD into the source code directory and run "setup.cmd".

-----

Using Timber as a Windows service:

1) First you need to create the executable, for which you can use the 'setup.cmd'
script (Py2EXE is required for this). Files will be in the .\dist folder.

2) Create folder "C:\Timber" and copy in all the executables

3) Config your INI file at "C:\Timber\Timber.ini"

4) Run the following command to install the service: instsrv Timber C:\Timber\SRVANY.EXE

5) Configure in the Registry at HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Timber
	OR
   Double-click the file "service_config.reg" to install parameters

6) Configure startup options etc. with the Services Manager
