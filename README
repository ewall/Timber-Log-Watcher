Description: Tails a log file and sends alert emails when the watched terms are seen.

Usage: Configure Timber.ini with the global options and words you want to watch for.

Requires: Python 2.x

Platforms: Should work on any platform with a Python interpretter, but my intention
was to use it as a Windows service.

-----

Using Timber as a Windows service:

1) First you need to create the executable, for which you can use the 'setup.cmd'
script (Py2EXE is required for this). Files will be in the .\dist folder.

2) Create folder "C:\Timber" and copy in all the executables

3) Config your INI file at "C:\Timber\Timber.ini"

4) Run the following command to install the service: instsrv Timber C:\Timber\SRVANY.EXE

5) Configure in the Registry at HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Timber
	OR
   Double-click the file "service_config.reg" to install parameters

6) Configure startup options etc. with the Services Manager

-----

TO DO:

Make a resilience option which allows the program to wait for the target file to be ready.
(Currently, it just quits if not found.)
